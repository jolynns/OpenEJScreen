Installing and using R-Bridge

ESRI has several tutorials on installing and using the R-Bridge. ESRI Canada has a
set of PDF files or ESRI has an online tutorial you can follow.

Once the R-Bridge has been installed perform the following steps to create an OEJS assessment.

1. Download the data from the EPA, unzip and add it to a new ArcGIS Pro project.
ftp://newftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN/2017/EJSCREEN_2017_StatePctile.gdb.zip

2. Select by attribute the state you want to perform the OpenEJScreen analysis on and create a new feature class with the selection.

3. Using R-Studio open the OpenEJScreen_Create.R script and edit the location of the input and output files.
input = your newly created feature class
output = the location of where you will write out the results of OpenEJScreen. Please note that the R script will not overwrite a file with the same name.

3. Save your changes and run the R script.

4. Back in ArcGIS Pro you should have a new feature class that will contain the following three fields.

OEJS_Score - The score between 0 - 100
OEJS_Rank - The rank for the score
OEJS_PctRank - The percentile for the rank

5. Using the percentile ranking you can view OEJS_PctRank on a graduated scale using a 5 class quantile to find the population
at the top 20 percentile that is disproportionately impacted.
